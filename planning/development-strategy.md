# Development and Strategy

## Project Overview

Users can easily add, edit, and organize items, enhancing convenience and
efficiency. Accessible anytime, anywhere, the app aims to streamline the
shopping experience for users.

## Development Approach

- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide the project into distinct modules, each
  responsible for a specific aspect of functionality.
- **Modular Design**: Encapsulate related functionalities within modules to
  promote reusability and maintainability.
- **Code Organization**: Maintain a clear folder structure to organize different
  types of modules.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for each module to ensure functionality and
  catch potential bugs early in the development process.
- **Version Control**: Utilize a version control system like Git to track
  changes.

## Module Types

There will be different types of tasks for each user story:

- `type: components`: Responsible for rendering UI components.
- `type: css`: Handling styles and layout.
- `type: logic`: Implementing business logic and data manipulation.
- `type: handlers`: Managing user interactions and event handling.
- Additional types can be added as needed based on project requirements.
